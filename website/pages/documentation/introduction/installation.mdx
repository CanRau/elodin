## Installation

Depending on which target(s) you're building for, there are different installation steps and requirements.<br>
Usually you'll start by installing the core package and the CLI.

```sh
yarn add @elodin/core @elodin/cli
```

Alternatively, one can also use npm.

```sh
npm i --save @elodin/core @elodin/cli
```
