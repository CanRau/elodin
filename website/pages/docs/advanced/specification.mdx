# Specification

This document will serve as a reference for all the language features.

> **Note**: For now, we won't log changes and versions as its still an experimental WIP and subject to big changes.

### Top-Level Constructs

The Language consists of 4 major constructs that are defined at top level which are View, Text, Fragment and Variant.  
Apart from that, it specificies a simple module system with imports.<br />
At the end, it also specifies a standard library consisting of a set of useful functions to compose declaration values.

## View

```
view Button {
  flexGrow: 1
  paddingTop: 10
  backgroundColor: red
  [Type=Primary] {
    backgroundColor: green
  }
}
```

Views are the main building blocks of Elodin. They contain style declarations for a single view component which in general is a reuseable, user interface component.

Views are declared using the **view** keyword followed by a **view name** and a **declaration block**.  
The view name is an [Identifier](#identifier) starting with a capital letter. It is unique for each file.  
The declaration block consists of [declarations](#declaration) and [conditional declarations](#conditionaldeclaration). It supports all kind of view specific properties.

## Text

```
text ButtonText {
  fontSize: 18
  lineHeight: 1.5
  color: green
}
```

Text is another main building block of Elodin. They are very similar to Views except that they're exclusively for text components. It supports all kind of text specific properties.

### Declaration

```
backgroundColor: red
```

A declaration is a pair of **property** and **value** where property is an camelCased Identifier and value is a single instance of one of the [types](#types) mentioned later. It is separated using a colon.
A declaration that references a [variable](#variable) is called dynamic declaration and is resolved during runtime. The variable value might also change over time.

> **Validation System**: While any property-value pair is syntactically valid, there's a strong validation system that will throw if wrong values or properties are applied. Check the [Properties](Properties.md) documentation for detail information on all available properties and their allowed value types. Beware that View and Text accept different properties.

#### Raw Property

```
__background: url("/static/test.jpg")
```

There also is a raw property syntax prefixed with a double `_`.
It can be used to inject target-specific properties that are not part of the Elodin type system.

### ConditionalDeclaration

```
[Type=Primary] {
  backgroundColor: red
}
```

Conditional declarations are special declarations that are only applied if a given **condition** is fulfilled. Think of them as if-statements.

#### Condition

```
Type=Primary
```

A condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.
One can check [variant](#variant) values, [variable](#variable) values and [environment](#environment) variable values. Boolean variables use a shorthand notation.

Valid condition operators are `=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, and `<`.

## Fragment

```
fragment Flex {
  flexDirection: column
  alignSelf: stretch
}
```

## Variant

```
variant Mode {
  Dark
  Light
}
```

## Types

### Identifier
