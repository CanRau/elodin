# Editor Plugins

Editor integrations can be crucial in improving the developer experience and effectiveness when using a language.<br />
Right now, we only provide a plugin for [Visual Studio Code]() called [language-elodin]().<br />
It provides basic language features such as:

- Bracket Matching
- Syntax Highlighting
- Autocompletion

It is recommend to use any integration in combination with [Prettier]() and [prettier-plugin-elodin]() which adds automatic code formatting for Elodin files using [@elodin/format]() under the hood.
