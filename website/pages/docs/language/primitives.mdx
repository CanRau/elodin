# Primitives

Elodin provides a couple of primitives that are used to define property values.

## Integer & Float

Both are used to describe numbers, but not all properties accept both.

```
text Label {
  fontSize: 10
  lineHeight: 1.2
}
```

## String

String are used for identifiers other than property keywords.

```
text Label {
  fontFamily: "Arial"
}
```
