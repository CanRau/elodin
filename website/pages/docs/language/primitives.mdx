# Primitives

Elodin provides a couple of primitives that are used to define property values.

## Integer & Float

Both are used to describe numbers, but not all properties accept both.

```
text Label {
  fontSize: 10
  lineHeight: 1.2
}
```

## String

String are used for identifiers other than property keywords.

```
text Label {
  fontFamily: "Arial"
}
```

## Percentage

Percentages are used for values that represent percentage values and accept a number between 0 and 100.

```
view Button {
  width: percentage(50)
}
```

## Color

Colors are either color keywords or special color functions used to set color properties.

```
view Button {
  borderRightColor: red
  borderTopColor: rgb(100 0 100)
  borderLeftColor: rgba(100 0 100 percentage(50))
  borderBottomColor: hex(f8f8f8)
}
```

## RawValue

RawValues are special values used to bypass the type-check to pass platform-specific values.<br />
They're usually used with [Raw Properties]() and should be used with caution as they might not translate to other targets.

```
view Button {
  __transition: raw("all 200ms linear")
}
```
