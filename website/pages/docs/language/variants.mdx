# Variants

Variants help to define different variations of a single style without having to use variables.<br />
Usually, you'll use variants if you have a known number of static variations.

```
variant ThemeMode {
  Dark
  Light
}

view Button {
  padding: 10
  [ThemeMode=Dark] {
    backgroundColor: black
  }

  [ThemeMode=Light] {
    backgroundColor: white
  }
}
```
