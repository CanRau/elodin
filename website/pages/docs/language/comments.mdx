# Comments

Comments can be helpful to explain a certain line of code or add some notes for other developers.<br />
In Elodin, there're only single line comments, if you want a comment spread over multiple lines, simply use multiple single line comments.

## Example

```elodin
variant Mode {
  # the better mode
  Light
  # the hipster one, required to be cool
  Mode
}

# This is our main Button
view Button {
  padding: 10
  # we set a marginBottom to ensure that
  # they're never paired with text directly
  marginBottom: 5
}
```
