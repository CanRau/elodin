# Variables

Apart from primitive values, we can also pass variables to set dynamic properties.<br/>
Instead of being rendered during compilation, variables are passed in runtime and can change over time.

Depending on the generator, the way they resolve might be different.

```
view Button {
  backgroundColor: $bgColor
}
```
