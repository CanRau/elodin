# The Elodin Styling Language

> **Warning**: Elodin is still WIP and experimental. It is not recommended to use it in production yet. There might be unknown bugs and the APIs might change rapidly.

Elodin is a styling language that aims to provide a universal way to author user interface styles. It uses a single file format that compiles to several different plattforms, languages, frameworks and libraries.
